[19:32:13] [chat] [thefatshizms]: there will be different kinds of food etc
[19:32:22] [chat] [thefatshizms]: cheap food = low cow quality 
[19:32:31] [chat] [thefatshizms]: expensive food = high cow quality
[19:32:39] [chat] [thefatshizms]: as well as it'll depend on the farm you have
[19:32:43] [chat] [Anaas]: the cow on the market is much more expensive than that sold by farmers.
