		 <thefatshizms> I have a big checklist kc
<Meta> try yEd
<thefatshizms> I generally use that
<thefatshizms> but visual aid is good
<Meta> http://www.yworks.com/en/products/yfiles/yed/
<kc> I see
<thefatshizms> My checklist is a few hundred lines long so visual aid helps a lot
<kc> I believe what you are looking for with that sort of task is a feature model
* Southclaw has quit (Connection closed)
<thefatshizms> Any way of creating a digital copy of one?
<thefatshizms> visio doesn't offer that (I don't think)
<kc> there is probably a stencil set you can download
<Khanz> Apparently in usa they don't care about plagiarism
<kc> but there isn't much more to it than boxes and lines
<thefatshizms> like this kc? http://www.feasiple.de/description/material/salesscenario-featuremodel.png
<kc> yeah but it doesn't have to be that complex
<Khanz> Just do a flow diagram
<thefatshizms> I have Khanz 
<kc> something like http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/E-shopFM.jpg is sufficient
<thefatshizms> Nice I'll make one in a sec
<kc> not supremely different to what you have but clearer for high level features
<dugi> so you want an use case diagram? 
* vmlinuz (69@ip-7aef0a13.mh.shawcable.net) has joined
<thefatshizms> That could be useful dugi
<thefatshizms> thanks
<King_Hual> >not using uml
<kc> nah I don't think so in this case
<thefatshizms> Ooooh nice King_Hual 
<kc> don't you do a btec? how haven't you heard of uml
<thefatshizms> I've heard of it
<thefatshizms> but never used it
<kc> but yes, use cases for lower level requirements
<kc> feature models for high level features, as what I think you were trying to get at with your mindmap
