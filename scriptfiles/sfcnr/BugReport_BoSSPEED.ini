Remove sf-cnr.co.uk/forums from the SAMP list thing and replace it with the new fourm link

You can /fix players when car does not need to be fixed.
Fix spelling mistake i.e. s.w.a.t to S.W.A.T
Add /AFK and /back but only for whites (civilians)
I can /rob while in car near you. Rape too most prob
I can /fixme when im the driver while wanted

Wanted when admin killed.
/robstore does not work >> nothing happens.
Add SWAT to /stats
Raping others makes your HP 1.
/radio does not work
If I place /spike and then get in my vehicle tires are popped.
You cannot /delspike while in your vehicle
/fixme is unlimited and has no timer
/stats is a mess. :c
AFK timer above head -> bugged.
Jailed but falling from sky.
After I died from falling, it still says "timeleft"
Anaas uncuffed me but it didnt say anything on my screen/alert me
The AFK bug is still here, it says "thefatshizms is AFK for 55 seconds"
